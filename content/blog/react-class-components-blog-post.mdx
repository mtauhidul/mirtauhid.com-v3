React 16.8 introduced hooks, which opened a new way of managing state and lifecycle methods in functional components. Before hooks, React relied on JavaScript Class Components for this functionality.

## React Class Component Syntax

In Class Components, a component extends from `React.Component`, and the `render` method is used to output what gets displayed on the screen.

```jsx
import React from "react";

class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  }
}

export default App;
```

## State in Class Components

Unlike functional components that use the `useState` hook, Class Components manage state using an object, typically defined in the constructor.

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { message: "Hello, World!" };
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>;
  }
}
```

## Lifecycle Methods of Class Components

Class Components have specific methods that run at different stages of a component's lifecycle. The key lifecycle methods are:

- **componentDidMount()**: Runs once after the component is added to the page, typically used for data fetching.
- **componentDidUpdate()**: Runs after the component updates.
- **componentWillUnmount()**: Runs just before the component is removed from the page, useful for cleanup.

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Component mounted!");
  }

  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, World!</h1>;
  }
}
```

## Updating State in Class Components

To update the state, you use the `this.setState` method. Each time `setState` is called, React re-renders the component.

```jsx
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
        <button onClick={this.increment}>Increment</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Why Functional Components Are Better

- No need for `this`.
- You can manage multiple state variables using the `useState` hook.
- Instead of lifecycle methods, you can use the `useEffect` hook to better manage side effects.

Today, Class Components are mainly used in older projects. For new projects, Functional Components with hooks are the recommended approach.
