# Maplysis

![Maplysis Logo](/projects/maplysis/logo.png)

**Maplysis** is a powerful, yet simple tool developed for **Geo data analysis** and **decision-making**. A very similar algorithm to **K-nearest-neighbor** is used to identify target zip codes and visualize them on an interactive map.

## A Real-World Use Case

Imagine an organization that wants to conduct **medical camps** at various points across the country for specific **health-related campaigns**. Instead of targeting every state, they are looking for strategic points from where they can access the majority of patients.

They already have the **zip codes** and the corresponding number of patients. Using **Maplysis**, they can:

- Upload an **Excel file** containing the zip codes and patient data (**dre**).
- Set an appropriate **radius** and the **minimum number of patients** required under a zip code for that area to be eligible for a camp.
- **Visualize the target zip codes** on the map to cover the majority of the patients.

After generating the map, they can visually analyze the data and download the generated **Excel file**. The file will provide the target zip codes, their corresponding **dreâ€™s**, and the **average distance** from nearby zip codes, helping in effective decision-making.

Generated Excel file.

## Tools Used

Maplysis was developed using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: Built with **React** and **Material UI** for a clean and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Utilized for logic building and algorithm implementation.
- **Google Maps**: Implemented for **data visualization**.
- **File Support**: Accepts **Excel/CSV files** for data input and result generation.
- **Deployment**: The platform is hosted on **Vercel** for seamless access.

## How to Use Maplysis

![A real example](/projects/maplysis/maplysis-1.png)

1. Visit the platform: [maplysis.com](http://maplysis.com)
2. Download the demo [Excel File](/projects/maplysis/demo.xlsx) for testing purposes.
3. Upload the **Excel file** to the platform.
4. Set the **radius** to under 10 miles and the **minimum zip codes count** to 7 or 8 under given radius.
5. Click **Generate** to see the map visualization.
6. Zoom in or out to explore the result, and click **Download** to get a file with the identified target zip codes and other relevant data.
