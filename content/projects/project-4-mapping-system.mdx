Have you ever wished you could see the world—one zip code at a time—to make smarter decisions on where to focus your efforts? **Maplysis** turns raw geo data into actionable insights, helping you target the right areas with ease.

## Project Overview

**Maplysis** is a user-friendly web app built to analyze location-based datasets, applying a K‑nearest‑neighbor–like algorithm to identify and visualize optimal target zones on an interactive map.

## Real-World Scenario

Picture an NGO that wants to run medical camps across a region. They have zip codes and patient counts but need to know where to set up for maximum impact.

With Maplysis, they can:

- Upload an **Excel/CSV** file of zip codes and patient data.
- Choose a **radius** (e.g., 10 miles) and a **minimum patient threshold** for eligibility.
- See **target zip codes** highlighted on the map, covering the highest patient densities.

After generation, the app produces a downloadable report showing each selected zip code, its patient count, and average distance to neighbors—perfect for data-driven planning.

## How It Works

1. **Data Input**: Drag and drop your Excel or CSV file into the upload panel.
2. **Parameter Selection**: Set the search radius and minimum patient count.
3. **Algorithm Execution**: Maplysis applies a proximity-based clustering algorithm to identify key zones.
4. **Interactive Map**: View colored markers and radius overlays on an embedded Google Map.
5. **Report Download**: Export an Excel file listing selected zip codes and related metrics.

## Key Features

- 🗺️ **Real-Time Map Visualization**: Instant display of target zones with intuitive markers and overlays.
- ⚙️ **Parameter Control**: Easily tweak radius and patient thresholds to refine results.
- 📊 **Data Export**: Download detailed Excel reports for stakeholder presentations.
- 📂 **File Flexibility**: Supports both CSV and Excel formats for seamless data handling.
- 🎨 **Clean UI**: Built with React and Material UI for an accessible, attractive interface.

## Impact and Benefits

Using Maplysis, organizations can:

- **Optimize Resources**: Focus efforts on high-impact areas, reducing time and cost.
- **Improve Outreach**: Increase camp attendance by targeting zones with the highest patient concentration.
- **Simplify Analysis**: Replace manual calculations with a one-click solution.

## Technical Highlights

- **Frontend**: React, Material UI for responsive design.
- **Mapping**: Google Maps API powers the interactive map components.
- **Algorithm**: Custom K‑nearest‑neighbor–style clustering implemented in JavaScript.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Vercel for fast global access.

## Next Steps

- 🌐 **Multi-Layer Data**: Add support for demographic and socioeconomic overlays.
- 📱 **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance touch controls for tablets and smartphones.
- 🔗 **API Integration**: Connect with third-party data sources (e.g., census or health databases).
