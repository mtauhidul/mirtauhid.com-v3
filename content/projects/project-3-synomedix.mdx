If you're looking for an innovative way to analyze critical patient health data in **ICU**, **NICU**, or **CCU**, **SynoMedix** is an AI-powered tool designed to help with **risk factor analysis** and **intervention suggestions** for patients in critical care units.

## What is SynoMedix?

![SynoMedix Dashboard](/projects/synomedix/synomedix-2.png)

**SynoMedix** is an **AI-driven research and development (R&D) web application** built to simulate real-world healthcare scenarios by using **hypothetical patient data**. The platform demonstrates how AI could be used to evaluate patient conditions and suggest interventions for various health risks in **critical care** settings. Although the application is not currently integrated with real **EHR (Electronic Health Records)** systems, it can be customized to interface with actual medical devices to gather **real-time patient data**.

## How SynoMedix Works

![Workflow Overview](/projects/synomedix/synomedix-3.png)

1. **Simulated EHR Data**: SynoMedix uses hypothetical real-world medical data to simulate patient monitoring in critical care.
2. **AI-Driven Risk Analysis**: The data is processed using **OpenAI's API** to detect potential **risk factors** and assess patient health.
3. **Intervention Suggestions**: Based on the AI's analysis, the application provides **intervention recommendations** tailored to the patient's current health condition.
4. **No Real-Time Alerts Yet**: Although the system currently lacks an alert mechanism, it's designed with future adaptability to incorporate one, especially once integrated with real-time EHR systems.

## Key Features

- <span style={{ color: "#FF4500" }}>**AI-Powered Risk Assessment**</span>:
  SynoMedix uses **AI** to analyze patient data and **suggest interventions**
  based on simulated scenarios.
- **Customizable Patient Dashboard**: Users can visually monitor multiple patients, view critical stats, and see suggested interventions directly on the dashboard.

## Technologies Used

SynoMedix is a **client-side** application, fully developed with modern tools and built to be **extendable** and customizable:

- **Frontend**: Developed using **React** and styled with **Material UI** for a responsive, user-friendly interface.
- **AI Processing**: The platform utilizes **OpenAI's API** to handle risk analysis and intervention suggestions.
- **No Backend**: Currently, there is no backend or database integration, making it a **lightweight** and **easy-to-deploy** application.
- **Deployment**: SynoMedix is deployed on **Vercel** for seamless access and scalability.

## Future Potential and Customization

Although SynoMedix is currently an R&D project with no real-world implementation, it holds **great potential**. The system is built in such a way that it can be:

- **Integrated with real-time EHR devices** for live patient data analysis.
- **Customized** to support additional features like alert mechanisms, real-time monitoring, and advanced analytics.
- **Extended** to accommodate more healthcare facilities or other health-related monitoring.

## Why SynoMedix?

![Potential Benefits](/projects/synomedix/synomedix-6.png)

**SynoMedix** offers a promising approach to healthcare, particularly for institutions managing patients in critical care units like ICUs and NICUs. While it's currently built for research purposes, the system shows how **AI can enhance critical care monitoring**, improving decision-making and patient outcomes.

Imagine being able to analyze vital signs, medical history, and risk factors using AI in real-time. With more development and customization, SynoMedix could serve as a **powerful tool** for healthcare professionals in managing critical care patients.
