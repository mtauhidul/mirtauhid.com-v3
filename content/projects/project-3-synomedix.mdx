## Why We Built It

Healthcare professionals need powerful tools to interpret complex patient data quickly. Traditional monitoring can miss subtle trends—SynoMedix uses AI to highlight those critical signals.

## How It Works

1. **Simulated Patient Profiles**: We generate realistic vitals and lab values for critical care patients.
2. **AI-Powered Risk Analysis**: OpenAI’s API crunches the numbers to flag potential complications.
3. **Intervention Recommendations**: The system offers evidence-based suggestions—everything from adjusting medication to ordering extra labs.
4. **Future-Ready Design**: Though we currently use mock data, the architecture is primed for integration with live EHR feeds and medical devices.
