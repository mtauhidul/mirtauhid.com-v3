## Project Overview

**Niblet.ai** (formerly Tally) is a mobile-first web application designed around a chat interface powered by **OpenAI’s Assistant API**. Users send a quick message—“I had oatmeal and berries”—and Nibble breaks it down into calories and macros, logs it automatically, and offers motivational feedback. Everything happens in one smooth flow.

## Problem Statement

Traditional calorie trackers overload users with manual inputs, drop-downs, and confirmation dialogs. This friction leads to abandoned logs and incomplete data. We needed an intuitive, feature-rich solution that feels natural, conversational, and lightning-fast.

## How We Solved It

1. **Conversational Interface**  
   We built a single chat window where users type or speak their meals. Nibble parses the input, logs nutrition, and responds with a friendly breakdown—no extra taps required.

2. **AI-Powered Parsing & Logging**  
   Leveraging **OpenAI Assistant API** and context memory, the app recognizes foods, quantities, and even past preferences. It auto-logs entries, only prompting when clarification is essential.

3. **Mobile-First Design**  
   The UI, crafted with **React** and **Material UI**, adapts seamlessly to any screen. Swipe gestures toggle between **Today’s Meals** and **Progress Chart**, keeping primary tasks within thumb’s reach.

4. **Seamless Authentication**  
   Implemented **NextAuth** with Google Sign‑In for frictionless access. Secure session management with server‑side NextAuth callbacks and role-based admin permissions.

5. **Real-Time Data & Persistence**  
   **Firebase Authentication** and **Firestore** power instant syncing and persistent conversation history—even across sessions and page navigations.
