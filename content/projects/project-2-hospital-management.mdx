Ever felt the chaos when patient files, staff assignments, and room statuses all live in different places? With **Care Sync Flow**, we bring everything together in one cozy dashboard—so you can focus on caring, not paperwork.

## Project Overview

Picture a busy hospital. Patients check in, doctors consult, and resources get shuffled around. **Care Sync Flow** is the friendly guide that helps:

- Doctors see their next patient at a glance.
- Receptionists welcome new arrivals with ease.
- Admins spin up rooms and roles in seconds.

## Why We Built It

Healthcare teams told us they were tired of juggling multiple tools and chasing down updates. They craved a simple, intuitive space where everyone—**Doctors**, **Assistants**, **Receptionists**, and **Admins**—could work together, in real time.

## How It Works

1. **Role-Specific Dashboards**: Every user logs in to see exactly what matters most to them—no clutter, no confusion.
2. **Real-Time Data Sync**: Powered by Firebase Firestore, updates pop in instantly across all screens. A doctor marks a patient as seen, and the receptionist sees it immediately.
3. **Room & Resource Magic**: Track room availability, assign staff, and fire off alerts when a room needs cleaning or an emergency arises.

4. **Smart Doctor Match**: Our little helper pairs patients with the right specialists, so you spend less time on schedules and more time on care.
5. **KIOSK Check-In**: Patients can tap, scan, or type to check in—capturing precise timestamps and freeing staff for what matters.
